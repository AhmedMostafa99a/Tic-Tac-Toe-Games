# Tic-Tac-Toe-Games
🎮 CS213 Board Games – C++ OOP Project

CS213 Board Games is a C++ application that brings together multiple variations of Tic-Tac-Toe and other strategy mini-games into one interactive program.
It was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (CS213) course at Cairo University.

The project demonstrates clean OOP design, code reusability, and extensibility by building new games on top of a generic board game framework without altering its core.
